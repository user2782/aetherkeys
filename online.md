# online progress

## start
visited alibaba (already used a couple times, okayish experience) to see if items I wanted to purchase were profitable and worth it after shipping cost, 
since this project exist, they were in fact defintely worth it.

## first order
since I had never bought keyboard accessories and items, I decided to go with what I thought were the safest items: keyboard switches from a reputable 
popular brand: gateron. most of my order was cheaper but still very popular switches, milky yellow pros, and I got a few expensive ones to also test 
the higher-end budget market, gateron oil king and ink blacks (these are also still very popular)

note: at this point, I was only planning to use all the parts, later down the line after making a second order and having a lot of spare items I decided to 
set up an online platform to sell these items.

### pricing
i priced my items sold locally by:
- converting usd to cad
- divide shipping cost (not part of below invoice) by total units, add this individual shipping cost to all units (i know this is not the best as some items cost more and should take a larger percentage of this additional cost but prciing wise all items msrp ended up reasonable)
- to get msrp i set a profit margin of 60% and multipled the [cost+shipping] by 1.6
- example: gateron milky yellow (35pc/pk) 4.55 usd to cad = ~6.20 + ~1.00 (shipping). $7.20*1.6 = ~11.50 (approximate sale price on my end)
  - note selling on services like amazon, there were addtional shipping charges to amazon and to customer along with sale commission hence price on amazon were closer to $17.99 due to such fees.

### entering market  
checking back with the market, my prices were perfectly reasonable (cheaper than all sellers selling the 35pc/pk), but noticed that I was close/a bit expensive compared to sellers selling a 70pc/pk, I fixed this by applying 10-20% discounts on mutiple units, this lowered profits but ensured I had the most competitive pricing. needed as I was a new seller and wanted to provide buyers some incentive to consider my listing over another established one.

same approach was taken with the other 2 gateron items i broguht over, i still kept some inventory to sell locally.

### shopify
- was too pricy
- trial period was too short, not enough time for experimenting for me to consider it worth it
- never opened ecommerce site so initial fees seemed too high for me
- pivoted away on 2024-06-23

### woocommerce
- site: [aetherkeys.com](aetherkeys.com)
- bought domain for 3 years a while ago (was not too expensive and would let me have some peace of mind knowing i have a website domain down)
  - purchased on namecheap, expereince is alright
