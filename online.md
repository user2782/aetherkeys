## start
visited alibaba (already used a couple times, okayish experience) to see if items I wanted to purchase were profitable and worth it after shipping cost, 
since this section exist, they in fact were defintely worth it.

## first order
since I had never bought keyboard accessories and items, I decided to go with what I thought were the safest items: keyboard switches from a reputable 
popular brand: gateron. most of my order was cheaper but still very popular switches, milky yellow pros, and I got a few expensive ones to also test 
the higher-end budget market, gateron oil king and ink blacks (these are also still very popular)

note: at this point, I was only planning to use all the parts, later down the line after making a second order and having a lot of spare items I decided to 
set up an online platform to sell these items.
