# online progress

## start
visited alibaba (already used a couple times, okayish experience) to see if items I wanted to purchase were profitable and worth it after shipping cost, 
since this section exist, they in fact were defintely worth it.

## first order
since I had never bought keyboard accessories and items, I decided to go with what I thought were the safest items: keyboard switches from a reputable 
popular brand: gateron. most of my order was cheaper but still very popular switches, milky yellow pros, and I got a few expensive ones to also test 
the higher-end budget market, gateron oil king and ink blacks (these are also still very popular)

note: at this point, I was only planning to use all the parts, later down the line after making a second order and having a lot of spare items I decided to 
set up an online platform to sell these items.

### pricing
i priced my items sold locally by:
- convert usd to cad
- divide shipping cost (not part of below invoice) by total units, add this individual shipping cost to all units (i know this is not the best as some items cost more and should take a larger percentage of this additional cost but prciing wise all items msrp ended up reasonable)
- to get msrp i set a profit margin of 60% and multipled the cost+shipping by 1.6
