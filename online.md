## start
visited alibaba (already used a couple times, okayish experience) to see if items I wanted to purchase were profitable and worth it after shipping cost, 
since this section exist, they in fact were defintely worth it.

## first order
since I had never bought keyboard accessories and items, I decided to go with what I thought were the safest items: keyboard switches from a reputable 
popular brand: gateron. I also decided to choose cheaper switches, milky yellow pros, and got a few expensive but high popular ones, gateron oil king and
ink blacks.
