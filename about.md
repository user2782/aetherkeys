## how did it start?

after gaining expereince building and modding custom keyboards, I looked into potential ways to better monetize my hobby. at this point I was building budget boards with parts ordered from aliexpress and amazon and selling them locally on sites such as kijiji & facebook marketplace. I then decided to develop a brand to make mass purchases on these items so that I could: 
(1) use for custom commission building (2) potentially sell. 

## what is aetherkeys?

aetherkeys is a half passion project and e-commerce business attempt. I decided to make large orders overseas through alibaba to get my needed items at 
retail pricing. in this way I could not only build cheaper custom commissions but also have an attempt to enter this market of sellers.
