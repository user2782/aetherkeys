## how did it start?

after gaining experience building and modding custom keyboards, I looked into potential ways to better monetize my hobby. at this point I was building budget boards with parts ordered from aliexpress and amazon and selling them locally on sites such as kijiji & facebook marketplace. I then decided to develop a brand to make mass purchases on these items so that I could: 
(1) obtain cheaper materials for custom commission (2) enter the market to sell parts.

## what is aetherkeys?

aetherkeys is a half passion project and e-commerce business attempt. I decided to make large orders overseas through alibaba to get my needed items at 
retail pricing. in this way I could not only build cheaper custom commissions but also have an attempt to enter this supplying market through online channels.
### about us statment i guess:
"aetherkeys specializes in the importation of custom keyboard parts. We aim to provide and widen the selection of products within this niche. As our     customer base expands, our primary focus is to consistently reduce product prices, ensuring broad accessibility to quality goods."   
note: statement used in amazon FBA and shopify 

## where can you find us?

you can find us (well me) selling locally on facebook marketplace, kijiji and recently amazon FBA & shopify. I believe the things I learn through my online  experience are extremely helpful but specific so I added a separate section that will go into detail on that process. 
- update: moved to building a woocommerce website. shopify store discontinued due to high overhead cost of service (2024-07-05)
